# Integrative Data Science


## Process

Working group to look at 1 year and 3 year horizon for

- Curriculum
- Pedagogy
- Assessment
- Data
- Processes


## Presentation Structure

- Motivation for change and problems to address
- Progress to date
- Suggested principles and outline proposals
- Next steps


See the 2018 module structure


## Motivation - Students

- More CS students at school (so better qualified)
- More international
- More with special needs
- More consumerist?
- More women (we wish)


## Motivation - Subject content

In schools â€“ from age five

Moving into core material 
- Security
- Machine learning


## Motivation - University

- Higher proportion of income from fees
- Focus on curricular efficiency
- Using and providing more learning analytics
- All departments to engage in curriculum review:
  - assessment
  - inclusive practice
  - digital learning


## Progress

- Working group
- Student voice
- Module changes
- Progress review with PVC education
- Staff discussion on projects
- Review of L1 maths
- Sue Black report on addressing diversity
- Presentation to EAB


## Working group

Identified need to track themes running through e.g. assessment

- Group work
- Presentation : oral & written
- Programming
- Project work
- Research skills
- Peer review


## Student voice (n=38)

- The amount of content is slightly too much (3.40)
- The difficulty of content is OK (3.22)
- The content is reasonably up to date (3.50)
- There are too many pieces of coursework (3.89)
- The coursework takes too long (3.79)
- The coursework is not really too hard (3.29)



## Student voice: more focus

- Machine learning/data science/AI (many times)
- Maths: linear algebra, calculus
- Software engineering: github and DevOps
- Programming: web tech, python, C
- Security


## Student voice: less focus

- Software engineering (many times)
- Web programming
- Prolog
- Some theory


## Module changes 19/20

- L2 Programming Paradigms
  - add Java
  - remove prolog
  - more C/C++
- L2 Software Methodologies
  - add machine learning
  

## Review with PVC

- [Very dynamic subject area](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-trends-emerge-in-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2018/) e.g. machine learning, security, blockchain, quantum
- Student and staff numbers increasing
- Need to be more efficient and creative with assessment and supervision
- Address and improve diversity within student body
- Some theoretical modules have low numbers


## Projects

- All students do one individual project, in their final year
- L3 project for MEng students could be group work
- Reduce number of assessment items
- Presentation on lit review half way through first term


## L1 Maths (Andrei Krokhin)

- More on classical maths
  - calculus
  - linear algebra
  - probability
- Too much for one module


## Increasing diversity

- Real-world problems
- Different programming routes
- Visibility of females at open days etc
- EDI statements by applicants


## EAB

- Module names are important
- Privacy is an important topic
- DevOps is important: distributed; containers; toolchains
- Survey alumni as well as current students
- L2+ interdiscinplinarity would be good


## Principles

- Reduce assessment points
- Increase cohesion; reduce coupling
- Inclusive practice: gender; international; previous study
- Integrate theory and practice
- Remove alternate year teaching


# Proposals


## Coursework

- One piece per module
- No coursework at level 4?
- Better processes for balance of effort and marks


## Assessment types

- Group work
- Contribute to open source projects
- Prepare publication/conferences
- L3 MEng students could help manage L2 group-work
- Presentations (oral, video)
- Reports
- Peer assessment


## Vertical structure of content

- Theory
- Data science: including databases; visualisation; privacy
- Artificial intelligence
- Programming including: web; scientific computing
- Systems including: architecture; networks; security; devops?


## Specific changes

- L1 Computational Thinking and other maths content
- L1 Programming: black and gold
- L2 less SE content, more AI and Data Science
- github for all programming submissions
- L3 Break up and rebuild: some smaller modules
- Redevelop projects


# Next Steps


## Measuring success

- Number of assignments
- Module registration numbers
- Student satisfaction
- Support for diverse cohort?
- Employability?


## Not broken - don't fix

- Accreditation (LSEPI)
- Timetabling (teaching and exams)
- Staff!


## Finally

- Develop with MSc content in mind


## Module review

- Can your module reduce to one piece of coursework?


## Discussion

- What should L3/L4 modules look like?
- Identify 10 credit coherent modules
- Choose to assess either with a piece of coursework or an exam
- Start with existing modules
- New content can be included
