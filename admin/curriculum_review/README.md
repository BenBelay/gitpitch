# Future of UG Teaching in CS


## Process

Working group to look at 1 year and 3 year horizon for

- Curriculum
- Pedagogy
- Assessment
- Data
- Processes


## Working group

Balanced by teaching/research group & gender + external

- Steven Bradley (chair) teaching
- Toby Breckon ICG
- Beth Bromley Physics
- Alexandra Cristea ICG
- Sarah Drummond teaching
- Max Gadouleau ACiD + Chair of Board of Examiners
- Matthew Johnson ACiD + Director of Education


## Progress to date:

- Depart awayday on streamlining assessment
- Staff opinions on areas that need: more focus; less focus; updating 
- Student voice: questionnaire circulated to L2,3,4 UGs
- Plan to write up as research paper on gender difference in opinions
- One working group meeting already held, more planned
- Detailed discussions with group leaders


## Issues

- [Very dynamic subject area](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-trends-emerge-in-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2018/) e.g. machine learning, security, blockchain, quantum
- Student and staff numbers increasing
- Need to be more efficient and creative with assessment and supervision
- Address and improve diversity within student body
- Some theoretical modules have low numbers


## Principles

- Reduce number of assessment points: synoptic where possible
- Apply software engineering criteria of coupling and cohesion to ease maintenance
- Better integration between theory and practice

[Current module linkage](prerequisites2018.pdf)


- Curriculum development needs to address across levels
   - Group vs individual
   - Presentation types
   - Project work
   - Research skills


## Going forward

- Redevelopment of key L1 module for 2019: Sue Black
- Plans for some rationalisation and development of L2 modules for 2019
- 2020 to address issues in L2-L4 around group and individual projects
- Aim for wider module choice at L3/4 as staff numbers increase
- Need to identify and track key metrics (working group)
