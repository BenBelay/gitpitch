## Client- and server- side

@ul
- Recently JS is also used server-side: nodejs
- Good JS engines in mobile browsers
- JS often used for cross-platform App dev [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
- Also for desktop applications with [electron](https://electronjs.org/) e.g. [atom](https://atom.io/)
- Interpreted, not compiled: errors only happen at run-time
- `console.log` is your friend

## Hello world

- Embed javascript in a web page
- Use `script` tag
```HTML
<html>
  <script>
    console.log("Hello World")
  </script>
</html>
```

---

## What just happened?

Nothing?

Looks the same as this
```HTML
<html>
  <script>
    vljbsv123456789!@Â£$%^&*
  </script>
</html>
```

Use developer tools to see the console output and error

## Hello again

In the browser we can also use the `alert` function
```HTML
<html>
  <script>
    alert("Hello World")
  </script>
</html>
```
Can run in browser as file, not just with http

## Importing code


- Link to external javascript code with `src` attribute
- Usually placed in `head`
- Can refer to files in same source
- Can refer to external files via http
- Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
```HTML
<script
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.7.2/p5.js">
  </script>
```
