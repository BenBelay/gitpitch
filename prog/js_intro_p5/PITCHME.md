## Client- and server- side

@ul
- Recently JS is also used server-side: nodejs
- Good JS engines in mobile browsers
- JS often used for cross-platform App dev [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
- Also for desktop applications with [electron](https://electronjs.org/) e.g. [atom](https://atom.io/)
- Interpreted, not compiled: errors only happen at run-time
- `console.log` is your friend

## [Hello world](prog/js_intro_p5/index1.html)

- Embed javascript in a web page
- Use `script` tag
```

<script>console.log("Hello world")</script>
</html>
```

## What just happened?

Nothing?

Looks the same as [this]((prog/js_intro_p5/index2.html))
```
<html>
<script>vljbsv123456789!@Â£$%^&*</script>
</html>
```

Use developer tools to see the console
