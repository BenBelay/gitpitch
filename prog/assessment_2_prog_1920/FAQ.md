## Client-side quality criteria

### Can I use react to build the web-site?

Not recommended: peer reviewers probably don't know what this is, and so may find it difficult to assess the quality of your solution.


## Server-side functionality criteria

### Are we allowed to include additional modules via NPM that provide additional functionality?

Yes this is definitely a good idea, as it makes the code easier to read, more robust and more maintainable. Bear in mind that some frameworks (e.g. react) that are installed via npm essentially use a different language, so are difficult to read for non-experts. They are best avoided.
